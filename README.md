# PDF-to-Speech

he primary objective of “PDF to Speech” is to develop a full-fledged Android application that can convert PDF documents into speech. With this application, users can listen to PDF content while driving, running, or walking their dog.

Before playing a PDF document, the user must select a file from their device storage (either the SD card or internal memory) using the built-in file explorer. Once selected, the user can play and listen to the document as if using a media player. The system extracts text from the PDF and converts it into speech using a speech engine.

This application was developed as part of my mini project for the Department of Computing and Information Systems at Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.
